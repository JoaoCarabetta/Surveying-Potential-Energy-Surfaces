# Surveying Potential Energy Surfaces


The study of potential energy surfaces underlies a myriad of systems of atoms and molecules such as protein folding, crystals and clusters. Due to its importance, computational methods were developed to characterise these hy- persurfaces. I will present the most relevant methods to find the global minima, minimum energy paths and transition states comparing possible implementa- tions of each. Also, the disconnectivity graphs will be introduced as a powerful graph tool to visualise an hypersurface. Finally, I will show how these tools were used to explore the PES of Lennard Jones clusters.
